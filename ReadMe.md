## Welcome to the Baking Management Application ##

Below are features for this project and how to use them

### Main Menu ###

The application opens at a menu screen with 2 buttons. One is used for performing your calculations; the left button. The application displays data from a CSV file, which is managed by the button on the right. Each screen has a navigation button to the other form.

### Data Entry Form ###

When the form loads, there are two lists. One has a list of data that you have added (the first time will have dummy data). If you select a item from the left list and click the add button, that item will go to the right list. You can select multiple items from the list on the left. If you want to remove a item from the left list, simply click on the item on the right list and click remove. 

After you have the items you want on the right side, click the calculate button in the bottom right corner. The text box above the button will give you a price based on your entries.

### Data Management Form ###

When the form loads, there will be one list with 2 columns. The left column is your type or category, the other is a price for that type or category. You do not need a dollar sign for this column. The bare currency format works (you may receive a error if you add the values in incorrectly). 

You can modify any line on the list. Once you have made your changes, click on the save button and that will save to the file on the application's back-end. If you then navigate to the data entry form, you will be able to see your changes.
